NOTE********************************************

        Every thing a customer and Bank employee do is recorded in the logs (data.txt)
        
        Bank employee's i'd is created by Bank Manager by directly going to the file (accounts.txt)
        
        Bank Manager have the right to see the employee's log only.
        
        data.txt will be automatically created in the folder once created account for someone.
